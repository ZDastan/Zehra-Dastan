# <Zehra-Dastan-Portfolio>

## Description
  
  This ia portfolio of myself.

  I enjoyed creating my portfolio by using new skills i recently gain.I divided to four section "About me , My work, My skills and Contact me".

  I build this project to keep my work and skills update to use during job search.

  I had a problem to place my work section on right side then i figureout later after short search.

  I learn so much about styling at CSS and i find it so fun!
